# House Price Prediction Model

This project is a house price prediction model built using linear regression. The model uses various data visualization and preprocessing techniques to predict house prices based on several features.

## Introduction

The purpose of this project is to predict house prices using a linear regression model. We use data visualization tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn to understand the data and preprocess it for better model performance.

## Installation

To run this project, you will need to have Python and the following libraries installed:

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## Model

The model is built using the LinearRegression class from scikit-learn. The steps involved in building the model are:

- Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.

- Exploratory Data Analysis: Using Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize the data.

- Model Training: Training the linear regression model on the preprocessed data.

- Model Evaluation: Evaluating the model performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

 ## Results
The model achieved the following performance on the test dataset:

- Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 20000
  
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 30000

  ## Algorithm :

  - Linear Regression

## Libraries Used:

- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
